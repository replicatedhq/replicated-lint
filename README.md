YAML linting tools for Replicated applications.

## Usage

Install the CLI executable with

```sh
npm install -g replicated-lint
```

Lint with `replicated-lint validate`

```sh
replicated-lint validate -f my-app.yml
```

or pipe from stdin:

```sh
cat my-app.yml | replicated-lint validate -f -
```

Results that have issues will look something like:

```typescript
{ type: 'info',
  rule: 'prop-configitem-testproc-run-on-save',
  message: 'If a config item\'s test_proc.run_on_save is not set to \'true\', test_proc\'s will not be checked automatically. Consider setting your test_proc\'s run_on_save to automatically validate inputs',
  positions: 
   [ { path: 'config.1.items.2.test_proc',
       start: { position: 8130, line: 325, column: 4 },
       end: { position: 8322, line: 331, column: 0 } },
     { path: 'config.3.test_proc',
       start: { position: 8692, line: 346, column: 2 },
       end: { position: 9141, line: 365, column: 2 } } ],

### Extending the CLI with custom rules

`replicated-lint` rules can be expressed as JSON, so it is easy to add your own custom rules.

If you have a custom rule set in `no-latest.json`, you can pass it to `replicated-lint` using

```sh
cat my-app.yml | replicated-lint validate -f - --extraRules no-latest.yaml
```

`--extraRules` can be specified multiple times. An example YAML rule set might look something like

```yaml
---
- name: custom-no-latest
  type: error
  message: "Don't use `latest` for container versions."
  test:
    AnyOf:
      path: components
      pred:
        AnyOf: containers
        pred:
          Eq:
            path: version
            value: latest
```

`replicated-lint validate` supports the following options:

```
Options:
  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]
  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]
  --infile, -f      Input file to validate. Use "-" for stdin
                                                         [string] [default: "-"]
  --threshold, -t   Threshold of of issues to report
                  [string] [choices: "info", "warn", "error"] [default: "error"]
  --extraRules, -e  Path to file containing JSON definitions for additional yaml
                    rules. Can be specified multiple times.[array] [default: []]
  --reporter, -r    Output Format to use
                     [string] [choices: "console", "junit"] [default: "console"]
  --outputDir, -o   junit reporter only -- path to directory to output junit xml
                    reports                   [string] [default: "test-results"]
```

## Developing


### Installing Dependencies

We compile to ES5 and test on nodejs 7.8.0, but earlier versions of node should work as well.

```sh
npm install -g yarn
yarn
```

### Running the tests

To run the tests once

```sh
yarn test
```

To watch files and re-run tests on changes, use the `tdd` script

```sh
./tdd
```

### Regenerating the documentation

`replicated-lint docs gen` will print reference documentation stdout as markdown. `yarn docs` will write it to `docs/gen.md`.

To update the docs in help center, grab everything in `replicated-lint/docs/gen.md` and paste it into `help-center/.../yaml.md`, replacing everything below `<!-- the rest of this document is autogenerated-->`.

## Library Usage

`replicated-lint` is designed with extensibility in mind, making it suitable for general purpose
YAML and JSON linting and policy definition

- Flexible, modular rule sets
- CLI
- Autogenerate unit tests and documentation from rule definitions

```sh
npm install --save replicated-lint
```

```typescript
import * as linter from "replicated-lint";

const yaml = `
---
replicated_api_version: 2.8.0
components: 
  - name: ELK
    containers: 
      - image: getelk/search`;


const ruleViolations = linter.defaultLint(yaml);
console.log(ruleViolations); // []

```

### Custom Rule Sets

`linter.rules.all` can be substituted or extended with custom rule
definitions. A rule's `test` field should return `{ matched: true }` 
when the rule is triggered by invalid JSON.

```typescript
import * as linter from "replicated-lint"; 

const yaml = `
---
foo:
  bar: baz`;

const testSpec: any = {
  Or: {
    preds: [
      {Eq: { path: "foo.bar", value: "baz"}},
      {Eq: { path: "foo.bar", value: "boz"}},
    ],
  }
}

const rules: linter.YAMLRule[] = [
  {
    name: "foo-bar-neq-baz",
    message: "foo.bar can't be baz!",
    test: testSpec,
    type: "error",
  }
];

const ruleViolations = linter.lint(yaml, { rules });
console.log(ruleViolations);  /*
[{
        type: "error",
        positions: [{
          path: "foo.bar",
          start: {
            position: 12,
            line: 3,
            column: 2,
          },
          end: {
            position: 20,
            line: 3,
            column: 10,
          },
        }],
        message: "foo.bar can't be baz!",
}]
*/
```

Register new rules with `linter.enginer.register`. Rules should implement `JSONReadable<Predicate<any>>`, usually as a static method

```typescript
import * as linter from "replicated-lint";


// rule MyRule checks if root object has property "spam" equal to "eggs"
class MyRule implements linter.Predicate<any> {
  test(obj: any) {
    const matched = obj.spam !== "eggs"; // fail when spam != eggs
    const paths = ["spam"];              // if matched == true, optionally include a path where a rule was violated
    return { matched, paths };
  }

  public static fromJson(obj: any, registry: linter.engine.Registry) {
    return new MyRule();
  }
}

linter.engine.register(MyRule);

const testSpec: linter.Test = { MyRule: {}};

const rules: linter.YAMLRule[] = [
  {
    name: "spam-eq-eggs",
    message: "spam must be equal to eggs!",
    test: testSpec,
    type: "error",
  }
];

const yaml = `
---
spam: eggs`;

const ruleViolations = linter.lint(yaml, { rules }); 
console.log(ruleViolations); // []
```

Custom implementations of `engine.Registry` can also be passed as a third argument to `linter.lint`, otherwise a default 
registry will be used.
