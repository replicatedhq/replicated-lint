## `spec-lifecycle-tip`

Did you know you can create custom, interactive workflows and messaging for your end customer by defining a lifecycle?



#### More Info:

#### Examples:

*Incorrect*: Spec has no `lifecycle`

```yaml---
specs: []
lifecycle:

```


*Incorrect*: Spec `lifecycle` is empty

```yaml---
specs: []
lifecycle: []

```



*Correct*: Spec has a `lifecycle` specified

```yaml---
specs: []
lifecycle:
  - message:
      contents: generating bundle...
  - generate: {}

```


*Correct*: Spec has a `lifecycle` specified and includes the default files

```yaml---
specs: []
lifecycle:
  - message:
      contents: generating bundle...
  - generate:
      use_defaults: true

```


*Correct*: Spec has a `lifecycle` specified and explicitly does not include the default files

```yaml---
specs: []
lifecycle:
  - message:
      contents: generating bundle...
  - generate:
      use_defaults: false

```
